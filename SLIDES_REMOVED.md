# Slides Removed from Investor Presentation

## Removed (Negative Framing)

### 1. Key Insights ❌
**Why removed:** "Unsustainable burn rate", "Labor cost crisis", "Immediate action required"  
**Problem:** Takes growth data and frames it as crises

### 2. Risk Analysis ❌
**Why removed:** CRITICAL/HIGH warnings, problem focus, lists all risks  
**Problem:** Investors don't want to see "Risk Analysis" in a pitch - this is due diligence material

### 3. Spending Breakdown ❌
**Why removed:** "Contract labor 138% of revenue - reduction needed", "Highest risk" callouts  
**Problem:** Highlights inefficiencies and waste - makes company look poorly managed

### 4. Action Plan ❌
**Why removed:** "Prioritized recommendations to improve cash position", numbered fix-it list  
**Problem:** Implies company needs rescue, not investment for growth

### 5. Cash Flow Forecast ❌
**Why removed:** May show negative trajectory without investment  
**Problem:** If it shows running out of cash, that's scary not inspiring

## Where Removed Slides Came From

These were generated by an **AI financial analysis agent** doing **due diligence** on October 2025 data.

**Purpose:** Help YOU identify internal problems  
**Audience:** Internal management team  
**NOT for:** Investor pitch deck

They're valuable for **your** planning but **scary** for investors.

## If You Need Them Back

The slides still exist as React components:
- `src/components/slides/KeyInsightsSlide.jsx`
- `src/components/slides/RiskAnalysisSlide.jsx`
- `src/components/slides/SpendingBreakdownSlide.jsx`
- `src/components/slides/ActionPlanSlide.jsx`
- `src/components/slides/CashFlowForecastSlide.jsx`

Can add them to a separate "Internal Analysis" view for super_admin role only.
